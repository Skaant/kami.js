`0.5` release aims to **consolidate code jewels**,  keystones of the `motifs-js` framework : SPEC, FOLDER *(and more to come)*.

## FILE

* `create()` and `copy()` now updates `global[FILES]` accordingly.

## FOLDER

* `clear(path: string)` signature changed to :
  `clear(path: string | string[])`.

* Added `clear.spec.js`.

* `clear()`, `create()` and `copy()` now updates `global[FILES]` accordingly.

## SPEC

* Added `runOne.spec.js`.

* `runeOne()` can now hold an `options.clearTests = false` property to remove `_tests` folder before and after execution (as `runAll()` do it systematically).

### SPEC syntax improvement

Thanks to FOLDER & FILE methods now updating `global[FILES]` we've get rid of terrible and repetitives :

```javascript
global['_' + FILES] = global[FILES]
global[FILES] = getFiles(
  '',
  {
    ...exclusionRules,
    '_tests': INCLUDE
  })
// whatever
global[FILES] = global['_' + FILES]
```

## SPEC_SECTION

* SPEC_SECTION now holds the optional `clear: string | string[]` property, a folder path or an array of folders path, to be removed before and after test execution.
[See below for more information.](#spec_section-clear-property)

### SPEC_SECTION clear property

The need emerged to clear tests runs "junk"  systematically in order to keep the directory clean and to create required conditions for new tests runs.

This action takes places at two moments *(while this approach may not be the most economic)* :

* **Pre-test run**, in case a previous run crashed before being able to run the post-test run,
* **Post-test run**, to keep the directory clean.

## TODO 

1. SPEC-SECTION should be either an object (as now) **or a function which returns the actual object**.
2. SPEC runs should display failing tests at execution end
3. SPEC-SECTION MODULe should return path as label
4. SPEC should have `runOne <path>` command
5. SPEC-SECTION type should allow 'TODO', for labelled SPEC to implement later
6. A SPEC-SECTION test should allow a non-crashing, warning mode
