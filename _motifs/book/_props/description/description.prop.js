export default `**ORDERED COLLECTION OF WRITINGS**

A BOOK content is made of smaller [KAMIS](#kami)/bricks :

* [BOOK-SECTIONS](#book-section),
  which split BOOK content in chapters or sub-sections;
  
* [BOOK-PAGES](#book-page),
  actually representing a scanned sheet of paper,
  but could also hold expected BOOK page outcome;
  
* [BOOK-EXTRACTS](#book-extract),
  which hold an atomic fragment of BOOK content.
  
**Note that BOOK is a top-level section
with just some specific meta-data.**`
