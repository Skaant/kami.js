export default `**INSTANCE ACCESSERS**

GET is currently an abstract pattern
which may be implemented on sufficent
occurence rate and generic logics.

GET can declined on KAMI's occurences purposes :
* Access and update folders and files content,
* Import ESM modules,
* Access and update data from databases.

In any case, an object instance is created to
represent the actual occurence.

In the case of folders and files,
a regular expression is used for matching.
