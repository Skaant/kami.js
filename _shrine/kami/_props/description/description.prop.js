export default `**The KAMI of KAMIS.**

Kami are "enlived" patterns, making them
not only **generative** but also **evolutive**
in a similar way classes and objectsare.

### Flavour

At the very beginning, KAMI-KAMI said itself, to be
brought to existence.

Soon after, it started to speak out other KAMIS,
which were instantly brought to existence too, following
a pure nodal self-organization.

For the generation to proceed it first had to
split itself in two : the KAMI concept and the
KAMI individual. The class and the instance.

It was about genericity and specificity.
And, at the end, dualism.

KAMI-KAMI had to become a KAMI like the others KAMIS.
It needed to be processed the same way to ensure
genericity.

But its specifity, the secrets of its generative powers, remained
absent of other KAMIS. It was the key of peace.

As so, it shared the same common nature, **the pattern**,
to all of its creations [the kamis], letting them freely
**extend and implement** its highly abstract powers.`
