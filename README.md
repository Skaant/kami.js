`kami.js` aims to explore the concept of naming and patterns. It creates virtual entities, the [kamis](#kami), to embody project's classes, components and logic.

## `kami`

![KAMI pictogram](/_shrine/kami/kami.picto.svg)

**KAMI** or KAMI-KAMI, also known as :

* [en] Idea, Word, Pattern, Spirit, God.,
* [fr] Idée, Mot, Motif, Esprit, Dieu.

### Description

**The KAMI of KAMIS.**

Kami are "enlived" patterns, making them
not only **generative** but also **evolutive**
in a similar way classes and objects are.

### Flavour

At the very beginning,
KAMI-KAMI **said itself**, to be
brought to existence.

Soon after, it started to speak out other KAMIS,
which were instantly brought to existence too, following
a pure nodal self-organization.

For the generation to proceed, KAMI-KAMI first had to
split itself in two : the KAMI concept and the
KAMI individual. The class and the instance.

It was also about genericity and specificity.
And, at the end, dualism.

KAMI-KAMI had to become a KAMI like the others KAMIS.
It needed to be processed the same way to ensure
genericity.

But its specifity, the secrets of its generative powers, remained
absent of other KAMIS. This was the key of peace.

By doing so, KAMI-KAMI shared the same common nature,
**the pattern**, to all of its creations [the kamis],
letting them freely **extend and implement** its
highly abstract powers.
